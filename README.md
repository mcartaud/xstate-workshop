Install the VSCode extension to have access to the graphs

## TODO

- Start by designing states and transitions for a timer
  - add more time
  - launch timer
  - pause it
  - reset it
- Instanciate your machine, activate buttons when they should, etc
- Handle the time, you'll probably will have to look at actors

If you finish early, try to transform this timer app in a pomodoro by adding another machine that will manage the sequencing between pomodoros.
A more simple alternative would be to do a pair-programming timer
